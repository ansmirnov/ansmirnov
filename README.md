### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Andrey. I'm a Systems Architect and a Tech Lead. 

I use my technical and managerial knowledge and experience as well as modern technology to design and implement successful systems.

My current research fields are decentralization, cryptography, and information security. I also follow interesting people and starred interesting projects in my and related fields.

I don't share my customers' code. I use Github to collect useful examples of how to use my favorite technologies.
