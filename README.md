### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Andrey. I am a **Blockchain Systems Architect** and a **Tech Lead**. I use my technical knowledge and managerial experience, as well as modern technology, to design and implement successful systems.
 
I research in the field of **Blockchain**, **Cryptography**, and **Decentralized Systems**. I understand the inner workings of technology: Bitcoin, Ethereum, IPFS, DHT, and BitTorrent.
 
In the past, I have written lots of codes in **Python** and some codes in functional programming languages.
 
I have had experience in a **DevOps** role. I've configured infrastructure based on Linux, AWS, and Azure for highly loaded applications. I've built pipelines for continuous application integration and delivery (CI/CD).
 
I study **State-of-the-Art transdisciplinaries** to be able to switch quickly from one role to another and remain in demand in a rapidly changing world.
